#### 1. Select ALL true statements regarding the ML.EVALUATE function?

A : All of the above.

    The ML.EVALUATE function can be used with linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, matrix factorization, and ARIMA-based time series models..
    The ML.EVALUATE function evaluates the predicted values against the actual data.
    You can use the ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate model metrics.

#### 2. What is the significance of ML.FEATURE_CROSS?

A : ML.FEATURE_CROSS generates a STRUCT feature with all combinations of crossed categorical features except for 1-degree items.

#### 3. Select ALL true statements regarding the ML.BUCKETIZE function?
 
A : Both A and B

    ML.BUCKETIZE is a pre-processing function that creates buckets by returning a STRING as the bucket name after numerical_expression is split into buckets by array_split_points.. 
    It bucketizes a continuous numerical feature into a string feature with bucket names as the value.

#### 4. Which of the following is true about Feature Cross?

A : Both A and B

    It is a process of combining features into a single feature.
    Feature Cross enables a model to learn separate weights for each combination of features.

#### 5. Which of the following statements is incorrect?

A : None of the above

    When we do feature crosses, we run into the risk of overfitting
    We use the Regularization process in order to prevent overfitting.
    BQML by default assumes that numbers are numeric features and strings are categorical features.
