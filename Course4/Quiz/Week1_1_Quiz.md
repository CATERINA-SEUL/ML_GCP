#### 1. Before being input into an ML model, raw data must be turned into:

A : Feature vectors

#### 2. A good feature should have which of the following characteristics?

A : All of the above

    It should be related to the objective.
    It should be known at prediction time.
    It should be numeric with meaningful magnitude.

#### 3. True or False: Training data sets require several example predictor variables to classify or predict a response. In machine learning, the predictor variables are called features and the responses are called labels. 

A : True

#### 4. True or False:  Different problems in the same domain may need different features.

A : True
