#### 1. What is a feature cross? 

A : A feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by multiplying (crossing) two or more features. Crossing combinations of features can provide predictive abilities beyond what those features can provide individually.

#### 2. True or False: We can create many different kinds of feature crosses. For example:

    [A X B]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of two features.
    [A x B x C x D x E]: a feature cross formed by multiplying the values of five features.
    [A x A]: a feature cross formed by squaring a single feature.

A : True

#### 3. True or False: Feature Engineering is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for three main reasons:

    You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.
    You can bring in your own domain expertise.
    Once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise.

A : True
