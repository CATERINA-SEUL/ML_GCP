#### 1. The main stages of Machine Learning models are?

A : Both A and B
    - Train an ML models
    - Predict with a trained model

#### 2. What are common mathematial models used in Machine Learning?

A : All the above
    - Linear methods
    - Decision trees
    - Radial basis functions

#### 3. In the past, why did neural networks models have just a few layers?

A : All of the above
    - Neural networks with lots of layers takes a lot of computing power
    - As you add more layers, there are more weights to adjust, and you need lots more data available to make those adjustments.
    - If you just add layers, you may run into issues, for example some of the layers may become all zero or blow up and become NAM(not a number).
