#### 1. Which of the following is the distance between two separate vectors?

A : Margin

#### 2. Which of the following statements is true about a decision boundary?

A : The more generalizable the decision boundary, the wider the margin.

#### 3. Which of the following statements is true about Support Vector Machines (SVM)?

A : Both A and B
    
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a particularly powerful and flexible class of supervised algorithms for both classification and regression. SVM are used for text classification tasks such as category assignment, detecting spam, and sentiment analysis.
    
    SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes. Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane, the points of a data set that, if removed, would alter the position of the dividing hyperplane. As a simple example, for a classification task with only two features, you can think of a hyperplane as a line that linearly separates and classifies a set of data. 

#### 4. What is the significance of kernel transformation?

A : It maps the data from our input vector space to a vector space that has features that can be linearly separated.

#### 5. Which statement is true regarding kernel methods?

A : In machine learning, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support vector machine (SVM).
