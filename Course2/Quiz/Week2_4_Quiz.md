#### 1. Which of the following is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers - given that a binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.

A : Perceptron

#### 2. Which model is the linear classifier, also used in Supervised learning?

A : Perceptron

#### 3. Which of the following statements is correct?

A : A perceptron is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

#### 4. What are the steps involved in the Perceptron Learning Process?

A : All of the above
    
    Takes the inputs, multiplies them by their weights, and computes their sum.
    Adds a bias factor, the number 1 multiplied by a weight.
    Feeds the sum through the activation function.

#### 5. What are the elements of a perceptron?

A : All of the above
    
    Input function x
    Bias b
    Activation function
