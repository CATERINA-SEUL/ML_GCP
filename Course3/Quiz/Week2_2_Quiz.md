#### 1. What are distinct ways to create a dataset?

A : Both A and B

    A data source constructs a Dataset from data stored in memory or in one or more files.
    A data transformation constructs a dataset from one or more tf.data.Dataset objects.

#### 2. Which dataset is used to instantiate a Dataset object which is comprised of lines from one or more text files?

A : TextLineDataset

#### 3. The _____________________ format is a simple format for storing a sequence of binary records.  Using _________ can be useful for standardizing input data and optimizing performance.  

A : TFRecordDataset

#### 4. The dataset object which has fixed-length records from one or more binary files?

A : FixedLengthRecordDataset

#### 5. Which method is invoked on the dataset - which triggers creation and execution of two operations?

A : iter

#### 6. From_tensors() combines the input and returns a dataset with a separate element while from_tensor_slices() creates a dataset with a single element for each row of the input tensor?

A : False

#### 7. Which of the following are primary purposes of Neural Network embeddings?

A : All of the above

    Finding nearest neighbors in the embedding space. These can be used to make recommendations based on user interests or cluster categories.
    As input to a machine learning model for a supervised task.
    For visualization of concepts and relations between categories.
