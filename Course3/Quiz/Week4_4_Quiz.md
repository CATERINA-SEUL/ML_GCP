#### 1. The Keras Functional API provides which of the following?

A : All of the above

    It allows you to define multiple input or output models.
    It allows you to define ad hoc acyclic network graphs.
    It allows you to define a model that shares layers. 

#### 2. Which statement is correct? 

A : In the Keras Functional API, models are created by specifying their inputs and outputs in a graph of layers. That means that a single graph of layers can be used to generate multiple models. 

#### 3. What is TensorFlow Data Validation?

A : It is a tool that can be used to analyze data to find potential problems in data.

#### 4. How to Input Feature Columns to a Keras Model?

A : We can use a DenseFeatures layer to input them to a Keras model.

#### 5. When is the Keras Sequential model not appropriate?

A : All of the above

    Your model has multiple inputs or multiple outputs.
    Any of your layers has multiple inputs or multiple outputs.
    You need to do layer sharing or non-linear topology.
