#### 1. Which of the following statements is true of TensorFlow?

A : TensorFlow is a scalable and multi platform programming interface for implementing and running machine learning algorithms, including convenience wrappers for deep learning. 

#### 2. In TensorFlow, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type (called a dtype).  All tensors are immutable like Python numbers and strings: you can never update the contents of a tensor, only create a new one.  

A : True

#### 3. How does TensorFlow represent numeric computations?

A : Using a Directed Acyclic Graph (or DAG)

#### 4. How can we improve the calculation speed in TensorFlow, without losing accuracy?

A : Using GPU
