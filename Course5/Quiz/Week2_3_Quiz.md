#### 1. What are the constraints used in the sigmoid activation function?

A : All of the above

    Weighted sum
    W transpose X
    Plus B from a linear regression

#### 2. What does the output of a sigmoid represent?

A : Calibrated probability estimate

#### 3. What is the significance of cross-entropy?

A : Both A and B

    Where the output is relatively close to the label where it's almost linear compared to quadratic
    Grows exponentially when the prediction is close to the opposite the label

#### 4. Why is regularization important in logistic regression?

A : Avoids overfitting.

#### 5. Why is it important for the gradient not to become zero?

A : Both A and B

    Training will stop
    Leads to a vanishing gradient problem
