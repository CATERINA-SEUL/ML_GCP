#### 1. Which of the following is an example of a hyperparameter?

A : All the above

    Learning rate
    Regularization rate 
    Batch size

#### 2. How would you use the Cloud AI Platform engine for hyperparameter tuning?

A : All the above

    Make the parameter a command-line argument
    Make sure different iterations of training don't clobber each other
    Supply hyperparameters to the training job

#### 3. How would you make sure the outputs of different trials don't clobber each other?

A : By employing a good naming convention for output folders which make it unique.

#### 4. How do you supply hyperparameters to the training job?

A : Both A and B

    Create the yaml file
    Supply the path to the yaml file via command-line parameters to the G Cloud ML Engine command.

#### 5. Model improvement depends on which of the following:

A : Both A and B

    Batch size
    Learning rate

#### 6. To improve the model, which of the following is recommended?

A : Goldiolocks learning rate

#### 7. A hyperparameter is a setting that we set before training, and it doesn't change afterwards.

A : True
