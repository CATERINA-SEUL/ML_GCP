#### 1. Which of the following is an efficient way to create embedding?

A : Use the embedding column method in the tf.feature column and pass in the categorical column that you want to embed.

#### 2. Which of the following is a disadvantage of dense representation?

A : Both A and B

    It is inefficient for storage.
    It is inefficient for computation.

#### 3. Which of the following is true about embedding?

A : All of the above

    An embedding is a weighted sum of the feature crossed values. 
    Embedding is a handy adapter that allows a network to incorporate spores or categorical data.
    The number of embeddings is the hyperparameter to your machine learning model.

#### 4. Which of the following statement is true about the logit layer?

A : For a logit layer, as opposed to a single logit, there is no guarantee that the total probability of all the digits will equal one.

#### 5. Which of the following statement is incorrect?

A : None of the above

    The Categorical columns are represented by tensorflow as sparse tensors. 
    Tensorflow can do math operations on sparse tensors without having to convert them into dense.
    The more dimensions you have, the greater chance of overfitting.
